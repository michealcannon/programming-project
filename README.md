# Programming Project

This notebook contains the project for the course Programming for Data Analysis 2019

The project requires me to:  
1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which I could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.  
2.Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.  
3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.  
4. Detail my research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook.

The real world phenomenon I have chosen is mathematics attainment among children in a primary school.

The variables involved are:  
1. Score in a standardised test of attainment.  
2. Records of attendance i.e. days missed in school in a given time frame.  
3. Age of pupil at time of test.  
4. Class level of pupil.
